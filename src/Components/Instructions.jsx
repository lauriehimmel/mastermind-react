                    You thought you retired. You thought you were out of the game. The president of Seiland, Joshua B. Krabsmith, had other ideas. "There's a code!!!" he said. "There's a code those dogs from Uxuiville have released to the public, and it will reveal our SECRET STASH OF CAT MEMES to the entire world. Save us! These memes are too funny for the public to see. You're the only one who can who can crack it - we need to guess the code in just 5 tries or else it will be released."

                    The rules are simple. Select a color, and then select where you would like it to fall in the code. Only when you have a full guess (4 colors) filled out will you be able to submit your guess.

                        If you crack the code, the system will alert you and your country's precious files will be saved.
